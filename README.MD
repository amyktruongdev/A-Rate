# SEA Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project

A-Rate:

<h3 align="center">My personal anime rating catalog I created to display data dynamically!.</h1>

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these ratings scores out of 10 might be lower than what I orignally wanted to rate them, but for the sake of data I had to make some lower!

A-Rate Usage
- There is an introductory text explaining the purpose of my catalog and tips on how to navigate through it.
- Each card has data values such as the title of the anime, the score I gave the anime out of 10, and my synopsis (opinion) of the anime or why I gave the score.
- The options bar has the options: "High to Low, Low to High, and Clear".
- "The High to Low" button displays the data in cards from High to Low based on the score I gave the anime out of 10.
- The "Low to High" button displays the data in cards from Low to High based on the score I gave the anime out of 10.
- The "Clear" button gets rid of all of the cards.

Anime is something I grew up with so it only made sense to make a catalog to show all off! This catalog has a personal few touches of mine, including colors I like and even Pompompurin, the yellow dog you see in the A-Rate logo. I planned my design initally using Figma and then went straight to implementing my design with Visual Studio Code.
This project was really fun to make. I now have a place to display all of the animes I've watched. It was challenging navigating through using JavaScript because I've only worked with it a few times, but the challenge was worth it!! I learned a lot more about JavaScript than I've ever had before.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!
